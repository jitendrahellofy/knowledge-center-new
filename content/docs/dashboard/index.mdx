## 📊 WhatsApp CRM – Dashboard Module Guide

### Real-Time Overview of Channel Activities & Conversations

The **Dashboard Module** in Hellofy provides a unified, real-time view of your WhatsApp channel’s performance. It helps you monitor tickets, chatbot sessions, campaigns, and user engagement at a glance—empowering teams to act faster and make informed decisions.

### 🪪 1. WhatsApp Channel Selection

At the top of the dashboard, you can switch between different **WhatsApp numbers (channels)** linked to your CRM. This allows users managing multiple businesses or locations to view specific insights per number.

### 🧾 2. Ticket Status Overview
Located at the top-left, this section shows the current ticket breakdown for the selected channel and date range:

| Ticket Category        | Description                                                |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Open Tickets        | Tickets that are newly created but not yet acted upon.     |
| 🔄 In Progress Tickets | Tickets that are currently being handled by agents.        |
| ⏸️ On Hold Tickets     | Temporarily paused tickets (e.g., awaiting customer response). |
| ✅ Resolved Tickets    | Tickets that have been successfully closed.                |
| 🤖 Chatbot Resolved    | Tickets resolved automatically via bot.                    |
| 🤖 Chatbot In Progress | Tickets where chatbot is actively interacting.             |
| ⏳ Expired Tickets     | Tickets that crossed their allowed resolution time.        |
| 👤 Assigned to Me      | Tickets specifically assigned to the current logged-in user. |

All statuses update dynamically based on ticket activity and support flow.

## 👥 3. User-wise Ticket Status (Right Panel)

This section allows filtering of **ticket data by user and status** (Open, In Progress, etc.). It helps team leads or managers:
- Identify workload distribution
- Spot performance gaps
- Ensure no ticket is left unattended
Currently, this section will show charts once valid data for the filter exists.

### 📈 4. Chatbot Sessions Over Time

This graph provides a **timeline view of all chatbot activity** across the selected channel.
**Metrics Tracked:**
- ✅ Completed sessions
- ❌ Dropped sessions
- ⏳ Ongoing sessions
- ⚠️ Errored interactions
Use this chart to understand how frequently the bot is being triggered and whether it's handling requests efficiently.

### 📬 5. Campaign Analytics

Located at the bottom of the dashboard, the **"Last Campaign Analytics"** tab gives you insights from the most recent broadcast campaign.

**Metrics You Can See:**

| Metric                 | Meaning                                                      |
