## 🏷️ Tags

Simplify your contact and chat management using Tags in Hellofy. Tags help you categorize conversations, segment audiences, and organize data for faster, smarter workflows.

## 📚 Why Use Tags?

Tags allow you to label and group contacts or chats based on custom criteria—like customer interest, lead type, or conversation stage. This makes it easy to:

- Filter conversations
- Target specific groups
- Streamline internal processes

✅ Tags can be created, edited, and assigned by authorized users or admins.

## 🛠️ How to Create a Tag in Hellofy

**Step 1:**

Go to Settings → Contact Management → Tags “+ Add Tag”

📌 This opens a pop-up window to enter your new tag details.

**Step 2:**

Enter a clear and descriptive tag name that reflects the segment or context it will be used for.

Example: If you're tagging leads interested in a specific product, name the tag something like “Plan A Leads” or “Interested – Premium Plan.”

Using tags helps keep your contacts organized and improves your team's ability to track, search, and act on important conversations efficiently.
