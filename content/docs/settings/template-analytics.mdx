#### 🔍 What You Can Monitor

For each individual template, Hellofy provides the following key metrics:

- **Message Sent:**
    Confirms that the message was successfully dispatched from the system.
- **Message Delivered:**
    Indicates that the message has reached the recipient’s device.
- **Message Read:**
    Confirms the message was opened or viewed by the recipient.
- **Number of Clicks:**
    Shows how many times users interacted with a clickable element (such as a link or button) within the template.

You can also apply a custom date range to filter analytics for a specific time period and compare performance over time.
