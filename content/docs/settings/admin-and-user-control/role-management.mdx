## 👥 Role Management

**Hellofy** offers a powerful and flexible **Role Management** system that enables organizations to define how different users access and interact with the platform. You can assign predefined roles or create custom ones based on your team’s structure and responsibilities.

🔐 **Predefined Roles**\
Hellofy comes with predefined roles that include fixed, non-editable permissions to maintain platform integrity and consistency.\
 🔸 **Super Admin**\
Has **complete access** to all features and settings.\
 🔸 **Admin**\
Granted most of the Super Admin’s permissions, but with **restricted access** to sensitive actions such as modifying account details or managing subscriptions (as per business setup).

🧩 **Custom Roles**\
To accommodate unique workflows, Hellofy allows you to create **Custom Roles** with fully configurable permissions. These are ideal for teams like:

- **Marketing**: Access only to broadcasts, contacts, and tags
- **Support**: Access to conversations and contact info, but restricted from settings

⚙️ **How to Create a Custom Role**

1. Go to **Settings → Role Management**
2. Click on **“+ Add Role”**
3. Enter a **role name** and select the necessary permissions
4. Click **Save Role**

     }
   />

🔁 **Dependent Permissions (Auto-Checked Behavior)**\
In Hellofy, some permissions are interdependent, meaning certain modules require access to others to function properly. When such a dependency is detected, related permissions are automatically enabled to ensure smooth functionality.

📌 **Example 1: Enabling the Inbox Module**\
If a role is granted access to the **Inbox** module (to manage and respond to customer conversations), Hellofy will **automatically enable** the following related permissions:

✅ **Auto-Enabled Dependencies:**

1. **Contacts**\
   → Required to view customer details while handling conversations.
2. **Tags**\
   → Needed for segmenting or labeling conversations inside the inbox.
   <VideoLayout
     url={
       "/assets/video/settings/admin-user-control/role-management/auto-enabled-dependencies.mp4"
     }
   />

These automatic selections **cannot be deselected manually** to make the Inbox experience consistent, functional, and free from errors.
