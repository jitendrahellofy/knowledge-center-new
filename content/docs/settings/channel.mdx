#### Steps to Create a WhatsApp Channel:
1. Go to **Settings**, and navigate to **‘WhatsApp Channel & Analytics’**.
2. Click on **‘Channel’**, then click **‘+ Add New Channel’**.
3. Log in to your **Facebook personal account** and follow the onscreen prompts. You can either select an existing business account or create a new one.
4. Enter your **WhatsApp number and OTP**. The channel will be added successfully.

    - **Channel Icon**: Choose an image that will be displayed on WhatsApp.
    - **About Channel**: Write a brief summary of your channel.
    - **Channel Description**: Add a few lines to help users understand what your channel is about.

7. You can also **generate a message link** and use it on digital posts or products to redirect users to your WhatsApp channel.
8. **Meta provides analytics** such as quality rating, message limit, message status, and channel status to help you monitor the health of your number and manage your campaigns effectively.
