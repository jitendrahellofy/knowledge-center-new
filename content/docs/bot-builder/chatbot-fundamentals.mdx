Creating your first chatbot in Hellofy is simple, but understanding how chatbots function will help you build smarter and more personalized workflows. This guide covers key concepts like trigger points, variables, message cards, and configuration settings like drop-off.

## ✨ What is a Chatbot?

A **chatbot** is an automated flow designed to engage users through chat. It handles queries, collects inputs, and guides users—24/7—without needing human intervention.

## 🚀 How a Chatbot is Triggered

To activate a chatbot in Hellofy, it must be connected to a **Trigger Point**. A trigger point determines when the chatbot is initiated based on user interaction.

**You can trigger a chatbot using:**

- **All Keywords:** The bot starts if the incoming message contains any one of the defined keywords.
- **Exact Keyword Match:** The bot only runs when the message exactly matches the keyword.
- **WhatsApp Template:** The bot is triggered after a specific WhatsApp message template is sent to the user.

These options allow you to configure bot behavior precisely based on customer actions or automated templates.

## 🧩 Hellofy Chatbot Builder Interface

The **Chatbot Builder** is the heart of your automation. With an intuitive canvas and drag-and-drop cards, it lets you build rich conversational flows.

**Key Canvas Tools:**

- **Auto Grid Alignment:** Helps you snap cards neatly for a clean structure.
- **‘+’ Zoom In:** Focus on specific areas of your bot by zooming in.
- **‘–’ Zoom Out:** View a wider portion of the bot layout.
- **‘[ ]’ Fit to Screen:** Automatically adjusts your view to fit the entire flow.

## 🚦 Trigger point

The **Trigger point** marks the beginning of your chatbot. It defines how the bot is triggered and connected to the next step.

You can add cards in two ways:

1. Drag and drop a card from the **Chatbot Card Library** and manually link it to the Start Block.
2. Click the ‘+’ icon while hovering trigger point and drag plus icon to open the card drawer and connect it directly.

## 🗃️ Chatbot Card Library

The Card Library offers all components to build your bot, organized into:
- **Send Message:** If you don’t require any input from user use this card.
- **Ask a Question:** Use this card to ask and collect input from users.
- **Connections:** Cards that create logic or trigger other flows.
- **Action:** Trigger actions like assigning, or updating info.
- **Utility:** Set up Conditions and more with Utility tools.

## ✏️ Rename Nodes

To keep your bot organized, you can rename any node or card. Click the edit (pencil) icon, enter a custom name (up to 32 characters), and your label will appear across the canvas, edit panel, and bot session logs.

## 🔄 Variables

A **variable** is a temporary container to store user responses during a conversation.

**Where Are Variables Used?**
- Ask a user for their name? Store it as `{{name}}`
- Need to save their feedback score? Store it as `{{rating}}`

These variables personalize the conversation in real-time and are visible only within the active session (they are not stored long-term).

## 🔢 Available Variable Types

| Type | Use Case | Example |
|------------|--------|-------- |
| String | Names, addresses, text, emojis, links | `{{user_name}}` = "Aarav" |
| Number | Any numerical value | `{{total_price}}` = 1500 |
| Date   | Dates or times | `{{event_date}}` = "2025-07-01" |
| Array  | List of similar items | `{{product_list}}` = ["T-shirt", "Cap"] |
| Object | Structured data with multiple fields | `{{user_info}}` = `{"name": "Riya"}` |
| Boolean| Used only in logic (e.g., agent online check) | `{{is_agent_online}}` = true |

## ➕ Creating a Variable

To capture a response in a variable:

1. Choose a card (like Ask Text).
2. Enter a clear name (e.g., customer_name).
3. Click **Create.**

<DefaultVector />

**Rules:** Variable names must start with a letter and only use underscores _ as special characters.

## 🗑️ Deleting a Variable

To delete:

1. Go to the same variable field.
2. Click the cross icon in the input field.

## ✅ Card Validation Settings

Validation helps ensure the user inputs meet specific conditions. You’ll find these settings in Ask cards like **Ask Text, Ask Number,** etc.
**Essential Settings:**\
- **Attempts:** Number of retries allowed.
- **Validation Error Message:** Show a custom message if input is invalid.
**Extra Validation:**
- **Minimum/Maximum Range:** For numbers (e.g., rating between 1–5).
- **Regex (Regular Expression):** For advanced text patterns.
**Common Regex Examples:**
- `\d{10}` → Matches a 10-digit phone number
- `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,}` → Matches email format
- `^https?://` → Matches links starting with `http/https`

## 🛑 Drop-Off Settings

What if the user stops replying? The **Drop-off** setting defines what should happen.
**Configure Drop-off:**
- **What should the bot say to the contact after the wait time expires?** *: Set a message like “It's been a while, and your session has ended”
- **What response should the bot provide if all its attempts fail?** *: Set a message like “No valid response was found thus the chatbot session is dropped”
You’ll find this under **Chatbot Settings** while configuring the full flow.
