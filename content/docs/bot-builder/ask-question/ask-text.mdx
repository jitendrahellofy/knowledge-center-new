💡 _You can also personalize your question using variables, like: "Hi @name, can you share your PAN Card number?"_

## ✅ Example Use Case

Suppose you’re requesting a user's **PAN Card number** to verify their financial profile.
- **Question Text:** “Please provide your PAN Card details to assess your profile.”
- **Variable Name:** user_details (or any meaningful identifier to store the input)
- **Attempt Limit:** 1
- **Validation Error Message (optional):** “Please enter a valid 10-digit PAN in the correct format.”

## 📏 Additional Validation Settings:

- Minimum & Maximum characters: 10
- Use **Regex** to validate input pattern:

regex

CopyEdit\
```[A-Z]{5}[0-9]{4}[A-Z]{1}```

This ensures the PAN format is:
- **First 5 characters:** uppercase letters
