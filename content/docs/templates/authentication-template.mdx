## 🔐 Authentication Templates
Authentication templates in **Hellofy** are used to securely verify user identities through **one-time passcodes (OTPs)** sent via WhatsApp. These are typically 4–8 digit alphanumeric codes sent during key authentication steps—such as account sign-up, login, recovery, or security validation.

## 🧾 When to Use an Authentication Template
Use an **Authentication Template** when you need to:
- Verify user identity during login or sign-up
- Confirm user actions for sensitive operations
- Support account recovery or security checks

If your app or service sends OTPs via WhatsApp, it’s mandatory to use an authentication template for compliance with WhatsApp’s policies.

## 📬 Sample Authentication Message Templates
Below are a few example formats used in authentication messages:
- `{{1}} is your verification code.`
- `{{1}} is your verification code. For your security, do not share this code.`
- `{{1}} is your verification code. This code expires in 15 minutes.`

<NoteInfo
  description={
    <p className="text-sm text-fd-foreground !my-0 px-2 py-2">
      <span className="text-primary"><code>{`{{1}}`}</code></span> is a placeholder that will dynamically display the user's actual OTP at the time of sending.
    </p>
  }
/>


## ✅ Authentication Template Requirements
When creating Authentication Templates in Hellofy, you must follow specific requirements to ensure your message is compliant and gets approved quickly.

### 📌 Mandatory Message Structure
Authentication templates include predefined text and optional add-ons. Here's what they typically contain:
- **Fixed Text:**
 `<VERIFICATION_CODE> is your verification code.`


- **Optional Security Disclaimer:**
 _For your security, do not share this code._


- **Optional Expiration Notice:**
 _This code expires in `<NUM_MINUTES>` minutes._


🧷 **Button Requirement**\
Every authentication template **must include a “Copy Code” button** that allows users to easily copy the OTP to their clipboard.

⚠️ **Restrictions**\
To ensure compliance:
- Do **not** include **URLs, emojis,** or **media** (images, videos, documents).
- Stick to **plain text** and required buttons only.


Templates that follow these guidelines are **less likely to be paused** and ensure a smooth verification experience for your users.

- Once configured, click **Submit** to send the template for Meta’s review.
- Approval typically takes up to **24 hours.**
