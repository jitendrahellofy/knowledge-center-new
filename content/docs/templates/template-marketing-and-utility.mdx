## 🛍️ Marketing Templates

**Marketing templates** in Hellofy are flexible and ideal for engaging users proactively. They support a wide variety of use cases-from promotions and greetings to event invites and reminders.<br />
These messages are typically initiated by your business and are not tied to a user's specific request or transaction.

  ## 🧾 Utility Templates

**Utility templates** are transactional in nature and are triggered by a customer’s action or inquiry. These templates deliver important, user-requested updates or alerts about orders, accounts, or services.<br />
These messages must be clear, concise, and informative—strictly avoiding promotional language.
