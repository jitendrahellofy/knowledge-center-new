## 🧩 What Are Variables in Template?

**Variables** in template are dynamic placeholders like `{{Name}}`, `{{Phone}}`, or `{{Email}}` that are automatically replaced with actual customer data when the WhatsApp message is sent.

These are mainly used in the **Message Body** to:

- Personalize your messages.
- Reuse templates for multiple users.
- Meet WhatsApp’s template approval criteria.

## ✨ Types of Variables You Can Add

You can insert variables using the **“Add Variables”** button. Available types:

| Variable   | Description                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name       | Inserts the customer’s first name or full name.                          |
| Phone      | Inserts the customer’s phone number.                                     |
| Email      | Inserts the customer’s email address.                                    |
| Add Custom |  Allows you to define a custom variable (e.g., Order ID, Appointment Time, Product Name). |


## 📝 Example Use in Message Body
#### Message Template:

`Hi {{Name}}, your order {{OrderID}} has been confirmed. We'll deliver it to {{Address}} by {{Date}}.`

When sent, this might look like:

`Hi Priya, your order #ORD12345 has been confirmed. We'll deliver it to 42 MG Road, Pune by 18 July 2025.`

## 🎯 Sample Value Field (Mandatory)

Each variable **must** be given a **sample value** during the template creation process.
- This helps **WhatsApp approve** your template by showing context.
- For example, if the variable is `{{Name}}`, a sample value can be `Priya`.

You’ll see input fields labeled:
- **Variable name**
- **Sample value**\
Fill both before submitting the template.

## 🔒 WhatsApp Guidelines You Must Follow
- **Variables must be clearly meaningful** (avoid excessive or vague placeholders).
- **No promotional content** can be placed within authentication or utility templates.
- **All variables must be mapped** at the time of sending — if any value is missing, the message may not send.

## ✅ Benefits of Using Variables
- ✔️ Personalizes messages at scale
- ✔️ Speeds up template creation
- ✔️ Saves time by avoiding repeated manual edits
- ✔️ Complies with WhatsApp template rules

## 📌 Tips
- Use **Add Custom** to create variables like: `Order ID, Delivery Time, Service Name, Meeting Link,` etc.
- Avoid too many variables — limit it to what is essential.
- Always preview your message using **sample values** before submitting for approval.
