With Hellofy, you can create and manage Meta-approved WhatsApp message templates for marketing, authentication, and utility-based communication. Templates enable you to initiate conversations, send important notifications, and drive user engagement with ease.
Meta requires prior approval for all templates—whether for greetings, reminders, promotions, or verification. This article covers best practices, template categories, statuses, and submission tips for hassle-free approval.

## ✍️ Rules for Creating Templates in

To ensure fast approval and avoid rejection from Meta, follow these core rules:

- **Template Name** <br/>
  Use only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. <br/>
  Make sure the name is descriptive and reflects the content of your message.<br/>
  ✅ Example: welcome_message instead of msg123 or template_001.<br/>
- **Avoid Restricted Content** <br/>
  Refrain from referencing or promoting restricted items like drugs, weapons, tobacco, or adult content.
  Violating this guideline leads to immediate rejection.
- **Do Not Request Sensitive Information** <br/>
  Avoid asking users for personal data such as financial details, government IDs, or passwords.-
  Use Proper Variable Format
  Variables must follow the format `{{variableName}}`. Always provide example values for clarity during submission.\
   **Example:**\
   `{{name}}` = John  
  `{{code}}` = 457821  
  `{{company}}` = Hellofy

## 📘 Template Categories

Meta classifies templates into three key types:\
**UTILITY**\
Sent in response to a user action or request.\
Must include clear and specific information related to a transaction or account.\
✅ Example: Order confirmation, invoice, shipping update.

**MARKETING**\
Promotes products, services, or encourages engagement.\
Can include offers, promotions, feedback requests, reminders, or event invites.\
✅ Example: “Flat 20% off”, “We miss you! Here’s a coupon.”

**AUTHENTICATION**\
Designed exclusively for sending login codes or OTPs.\
Strictly regulated and cannot contain promotional content.

⚠️ **Important:** If a template combines content from multiple categories (e.g., utility + promotion), Meta will classify it as Marketing.

## 📊 Template Statuses

Once submitted, a template can have one of the following statuses:

- **Approved** ✅ – Template complies with Meta's policies and is ready for use.
- **In Review** ⏳ – Currently under Meta’s review process (may take up to 24 hours).
- **Draft** ✍️ – Saved but not yet submitted for approval.
- **Rejected** ❌ – Didn’t meet Meta’s guidelines. Revise and resubmit.

## 🚦 Template Approval Process

When you submit a template in Hellofy:

- Meta first validates your selected category (Utility, Marketing, or Authentication).
- If the category is correct, the template proceeds for review.
- If Meta disagrees, the template is auto-rejected, and you'll need to revise it accordingly.

🔁 Approval typically takes up to 24 hours. Only templates with “Approved” status can be used in campaigns or automations.

## ⚠️ Common Rejection Reasons

- Using promotional content in authentication or utility messages.
- Template name doesn't match the content.
- Missing or misformatted variables.
- Including restricted keywords (e.g., gambling, firearms).
- Asking for sensitive data like card numbers or passwords.

## 📌 Best Practices

- Keep the content concise and specific to its purpose.
- Don’t mix promotional tone in non-marketing categories.
- Test your template logic and variables thoroughly.
- Name templates clearly to avoid confusion during review.
