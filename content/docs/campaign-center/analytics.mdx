## 📊 Monitor Campaign Performance
Once sent or scheduled, campaign insights are available immediately.

You’ll See:
- 📤 Sent
- 📩 Delivered
- ❌ Failed
- 📖 Read / Unread
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Contacts targeted
- 🔄 Delivery status in real-time

Each campaign also shows a preview of the message and full contact breakdown for accuracy.

## 👥 Create Contact Group from Campaign
You can create a new group based on message response status from any previous campaign.

**Filter By:**\
Campaign name
- Message status: Sent, Delivered, Read, Failed

This allows for:
- Targeted follow-ups
- Re-engagement campaigns
- Precision marketing

Example: Create a group of only those who "Read" the message but didn’t reply, and send them a new offer.
