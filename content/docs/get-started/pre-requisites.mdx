Want to connect with your customers on WhatsApp using Hellofy?
Here’s how you can set it up easily! Let’s go through what you need before starting.

## ✅ What You Need Before You Begin

### 1. Facebook Business Manager Account

To use WhatsApp for business, you must have a Facebook Business Manager Account. This helps connect your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp in one place. <br />👉 **Don’t have one?** Create it here: [business.facebook.com](mailto:business.facebook.com) <br /> You must also have a Facebook Page or Instagram Page for your business.

### 2. A Business Website

You’ll need a website for your business.<br/> This proves your business is real and lets customers find you online.<br/> It’s also needed to get approval from WhatsApp.

### 3. A Business Phone Number

Use a phone number that is not already used on WhatsApp.<br/> It must be a business number (not your personal one). <br/> You cannot use this number on the WhatsApp mobile app after you connect it to Hellofy.

## 🔒 Authentication Steps

#### Step 1: Verify Your Phone Number

WhatsApp will send a code by call or SMS to confirm your number.<br/> Make sure the number is not in use on another WhatsApp account or by another provider.<br/>
Already using the number on the WhatsApp app? You must delete that account first:<br/> **Go to WhatsApp settings > Delete my account.** <br/>
Or, just use a new number for Hellofy’s WhatsApp API.

#### Step 2: Connect Your Facebook Business Account

Link your Facebook Business Account during setup.<br/> This helps Meta (Facebook) know your business is real and allows a smooth connection.<br/> If you don’t have one, you can create it while setting up on Hellofy. <br/>
**Reminder:** Once connected, you won’t be able to use WhatsApp on that phone <br/> Chat history and contacts from your phone will not move to Hellofy.<br/> Want to switch back later? Contact Hellofy support anytime!

## 🌐 Your Website Must Have

To get WhatsApp API access approved, your website must include: <br/>

- **Your Business Info – Name, logo, phone, email, address**
- **About Us – Who you are and what your business does**
- **Privacy Policy – How you protect customer data**
- **Terms of Service – Your business rules and conditions**
- **Customer Support Details – Show you care about helping your customers**
