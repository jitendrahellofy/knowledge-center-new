Stay compliant, build trust, and ensure your messages reach only the right audience with Hellofy’s built-in marketing opt-in management system.

## 🔍 What is Marketing Opt-In?

Marketing opt-in is when your customers give clear consent to receive promotional messages from your business. It’s a respectful and legal way to communicate, ensuring users want to hear from you.

## ✅ Why Marketing Opt-In Matters

- **Respects Customer Choice:** Only send messages to users who’ve agreed to receive them.
- **Better Engagement:** Target audiences who are actually interested in your services.
- **Legal Compliance:** Stay aligned with regional privacy laws and avoid violations.
- **Builds Trust:** Creates a reliable brand image and improves user experience.

## 📣 Ways to Collect Marketing Opt-In (Outside WhatsApp)

You can collect consent through multiple channels outside WhatsApp:
- **Website Forms:** Add a checkbox or consent message while users sign up.
- **Email Signups:** Let users opt-in to newsletters or updates through email.
- **Social Media:** Use posts or lead ads that redirect to an opt-in landing page.
- **Events/Webinars:** Collect consent using digital forms or physical sheets during events.

## ⚠️ Risks of Ignoring Opt-In

- **Poor User Experience:** Sending unwanted messages frustrates users.
- **Lower Quality Score:** Your WhatsApp rating drops when users block/report you.
- **Account Suspension:** WhatsApp may suspend your account for spam-like behavior.
- **Reputation Damage:** Spamming harms your brand credibility.
- **Low Engagement:** Non-consenting users are unlikely to convert or engage.
