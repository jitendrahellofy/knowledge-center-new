          Phone Number Validation in Hellofy

        <br />
        You can select a country code for validation to ensure consistency in
        contact data.
        <br />
        If you import a file without a country code, Hellofy will automatically
        add +91 (India) by default.
        <br />
        Imported numbers will be validated using the selected country code,
        which will auto-fill for contacts missing one. <br />
        <strong className="font-medium">Allowed Formats:</strong> <br />
        With Country Code: 919876543210, +919876543210 <br />
        Without Country Code: 9876543210, 09876543210 (will be assigned +91
        automatically) <br />
        <strong>
          Note: If a contact number is already stored with a country code (e.g.,
          +919876543210), it will remain unchanged.
